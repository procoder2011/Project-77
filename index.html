        <h1>Project On Console</h1>
        <h3>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
             Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. 
             Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.
             Visual Studio Code was first announced on April 29, 2015, by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference. A preview build was released shortly thereafter.</h3>
             <h3>Console screen is opened when we right-click and open inspect to debug our code and check if we have any errors. It is used when we want to know if there is a problem with the code or when a piece of information isn't being displayed we can use it to check if our whole code is wrong or just the part where the information is supposed to be displayed. We mainly use the code "console.log" to display a certain variable or a tag's value on the screen.</h3>
